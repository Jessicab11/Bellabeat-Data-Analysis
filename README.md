# Bellabeat-Data-Analysis
This is the second case study that I am working on for the Google Data Analytics Certificate.
This is a work in progress. I will be updating this repository throughout the process.

### ASK 
#### Business Task: What trends are seen in smart device usage and how could these trends be applied to Bellabeats products to help Bellabeats grow?

### PREPARE 
Some data was provided, but I will be looking for more data sources as I narrow in on what information I would like to focus on. I am currently using Excel to clean the data. I started by making sure there were no duplicates, checking the spelling, and making sure that data types were consistent throughout.

### ANALYZE 
I plan to use SQL and Excel to analyze the data.

### SHARE 
I am planning to use Tableau to create a dashboard as well as a slide presentation.

### ACT
