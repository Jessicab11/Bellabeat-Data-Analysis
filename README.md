# Bellabeat-Data-Analysis
This is the second case study that I am working on for the Google Data Analytics Certificate.
This is a work in progress. I will be updating this repository throughout the process.

ASK: Business Task: What trends are seen in smart device usage and how could these trends be applied to Bellabeats products to help Bellabeats grow?
PREPARE: Some data was provided, but I will be looking for more data sources as I narrow in on what information I would like to focus on. I am currently using SQL and Excel to clean the data.
ANALYZE: I plan to use SQL and Excel to analyze the data.
SHARE: I am planning to use Tableau to create a dashboard as well as a slide presentation.
ACT:
